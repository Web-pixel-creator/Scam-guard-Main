# Changelog (AI memory)

Newest first. This tracks documentation/memory files, not every code commit.

## 2026-06-01 - Production-readiness sync

- Updated AI memory to reflect the actual runtime: self-hosted Node/Nitro `node-server`, Docker/Railway-ready, no Lovable Cloud production dependency.
- Updated AI integration docs from Lovable/Gemini to provider-neutral OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`).
- Marked Telegram bot MVP as implemented and documented the webhook/session architecture.
- Added `pressauz` as a local research feed for new Uzbekistan scam patterns.
- Recorded privacy hardening: report descriptions and OCR model output must be deterministically redacted before persistence/use.

## 2026-05-30 - Initial AI memory created

- Analyzed the real codebase and supplied zip.
- Created `AI_INDEX.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `ai_docs/`.
- Mapped TanStack Start + React 19 + Supabase stack, server-function RPC layer, rules-first risk engine, DB schema/RLS, auth/role model and deployment notes.
- Documented competitor/market research and current Uzbekistan scam landscape.
