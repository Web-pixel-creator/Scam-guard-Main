# Changelog (AI memory)

Newest first. This tracks documentation/memory files, not every code commit.

## 2026-06-02 - Lovable build wrapper removed

- Updated architecture/deployment/tooling docs for direct Vite/TanStack/Nitro configuration.
- Recorded that the Lovable-authored design remains, but Lovable-specific build tooling is no longer part of the production path.
- Removed the stale `lovable-error-reporting.ts` file map reference.

## 2026-06-02 - Research-feed scam coverage rules

- Documented `known_reported`, `fake_delivery_payment`, `fake_boss_request`, `malicious_file_bait`, and stronger `payment_before_service` coverage.
- Updated `SCAM_COVERAGE.md` and `OPEN_TASKS.md` so completed research-feed patterns no longer appear as planned work.
- Recorded the removal of the old high-risk entity APK proxy in favor of `known_reported`.

## 2026-06-01 - Production-readiness sync

- Updated AI memory to reflect the actual runtime: self-hosted Node/Nitro `node-server`, Docker/Railway-ready, no Lovable Cloud production dependency.
- Updated AI integration docs from Lovable/Gemini to provider-neutral OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`).
- Marked Telegram bot MVP as implemented and documented the webhook/session architecture.
- Added `pressauz` as a local research feed for new Uzbekistan scam patterns.
- Recorded privacy hardening: report descriptions and OCR model output must be deterministically redacted before persistence/use.

## 2026-05-30 - Initial AI memory created

- Analyzed the real codebase and supplied zip.
- Created `AI_INDEX.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `ai_docs/`.
- Mapped TanStack Start + React 19 + Supabase stack, server-function RPC layer, rules-first risk engine, DB schema/RLS, auth/role model and deployment notes.
- Documented competitor/market research and current Uzbekistan scam landscape.
