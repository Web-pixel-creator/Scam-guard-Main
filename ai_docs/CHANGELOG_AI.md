# Changelog (AI memory)

Newest first. This tracks documentation/memory files, not every code commit.

## 2026-06-01 — Production deploy + pre-deploy hardening

- **Deployed to Railway** (https://scam-guard-main-production.up.railway.app). Telegram webhook registered, bot live at @scamguard_bot.
- PR #17: pre-deploy hardening — fixed .gitignore NUL bytes, removed duplicate consolidated migration, switched Dockerfile to Bun, enabled short-code verified lookup in pipeline, added verified contact UI to web RiskResultCard, fixed check logging order (finalLevel), updated README/OPEN_TASKS.
- PR #16: `/panic` interactive emergency mode — inline buttons for 6 scenarios instead of one big text wall.
- PR #15: dynamic `/emergency` checklist pulling real numbers from verified-contacts module.
- PR #14: integrated verified contacts into risk engine + Telegram formatter (badge + spoofing warning, dangerous override).
- PR #13: expanded verified contacts seed to 27 entries (banks, telecoms, payment systems, government, UZCERT).
- PR #12: initial verified contacts module.
- PR #11: public README + CONTRIBUTING.md.
- PR #10: CI workflow, /healthz endpoint, Dockerfile VITE_* ARGs, .gitignore fix.
- Supabase migrations applied (8 migrations; consolidated duplicate removed).
- 215+ tests, CI green, production build verified.

## 2026-06-02 - Payment input detector

- Added a conservative `payment` input detector for payment-flow text.
- Updated `OPEN_TASKS.md` and `SCAM_COVERAGE.md` so payment detection is no longer listed as missing.
- Recorded the detector boundaries: pure URLs/APKs/Telegram links keep their primary type.

## 2026-06-02 - Lovable build wrapper removed

- Updated architecture/deployment/tooling docs for direct Vite/TanStack/Nitro configuration.
- Recorded that the Lovable-authored design remains, but Lovable-specific build tooling is no longer part of the production path.
- Removed the stale `lovable-error-reporting.ts` file map reference.

## 2026-06-02 - Research-feed scam coverage rules

- Documented `known_reported`, `fake_delivery_payment`, `fake_boss_request`, `malicious_file_bait`, and stronger `payment_before_service` coverage.
- Updated `SCAM_COVERAGE.md` and `OPEN_TASKS.md` so completed research-feed patterns no longer appear as planned work.
- Recorded the removal of the old high-risk entity APK proxy in favor of `known_reported`.

## 2026-06-01 - Production-readiness sync

- Updated AI memory to reflect the actual runtime: self-hosted Node/Nitro `node-server`, Docker/Railway-ready, no Lovable Cloud production dependency.
- Updated AI integration docs from Lovable/Gemini to provider-neutral OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`).
- Marked Telegram bot MVP as implemented and documented the webhook/session architecture.
- Added `pressauz` as a local research feed for new Uzbekistan scam patterns.
- Recorded privacy hardening: report descriptions and OCR model output must be deterministically redacted before persistence/use.

## 2026-05-30 - Initial AI memory created

- Analyzed the real codebase and supplied zip.
- Created `AI_INDEX.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `ai_docs/`.
- Mapped TanStack Start + React 19 + Supabase stack, server-function RPC layer, rules-first risk engine, DB schema/RLS, auth/role model and deployment notes.
- Documented competitor/market research and current Uzbekistan scam landscape.
